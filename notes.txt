Static Rendering(Next 13) Replaced with getStaticProps(Next 12)
Dynamic Rendering(Next 13) Replaced with getServerSideProps(Next 12)

By default all the server components are rendered staticly.
Means it will compile the project and cached the data on the server and after that if we request data again it will give cached version rather than fetching data again.

In Dynamic Rendering Routes are rendered for each user at a request time
(Here we prevent caching)
